<h1>What we Learned</h1><br>
<h2>We learned how to <em>.</em><br>1st design 2nd build 3rd program
1 design,we had to look through alot of diffrint designs and had to find one we liked.We looked throw alot and alot did not work.we found wone easy to build and it really<br>
works.We had a little compitition to see who drove and you could to it's a fair way to dicide.We still all get to drive but they get more time because<br>
they had to practise.
2 building was easy for us but only because we were used to lego we are 10 year olds. But if you,re not used to  it thats fine just keep<br>
practising and it might take some time but i am sure you will get the hang of it.So buildiing f
  irst you need to now what you are building<br>
and then you can actuly start.You will need you're bricks or whatever you're building with.We followed the instructions but don't be afraid to wing it<br>
and if you find winging it diffucult then just follow the instructions.We were so happy when we finished and i bet you would be to, so try not break it.<br>
We did and we were sad but we fixed all are probloms and modifide it so i guess it helped us so if you break it then don't be annoyed, it realy helps.<br>
3 Programing can be tuff believe me but if you try you can do it.We could not code at first<br>
but then we started to get the hang of it and started to make less mistakes until<br>
eventually we got it perfect.we yoused robot c alot like scratch and makes it easier for use but use whatever suits. We would say <br> 
practise or research it and then show your class.
