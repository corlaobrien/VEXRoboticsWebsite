	<p>In the competition there were two types of gamemodes, there was manual where you used a controler<br> to control 
	the robot and there was autonomous mode where you coded the robot to get as many points as possible.<br>
        We used <em> Robot C graphical </em> to code the robot, you drag and drop the diffrent commands to code it.<br> 
	When your done the code you use a cable connected to the robots brain to insert the code into the robot.<br></p>
        We had two blocks of code, one was to knock the extra rings at the end of the arena.<br> The other block picks up one set 
	of rings of the pole and puts on the opposite pole.
