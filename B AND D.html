	               the build and design of our robot</H2>
		
	<P>First we went with the recommended design the as can be seen above.<br>
	We broke it about 4 or 5 times but each time we rebuilt it we got better each<br>
	time,and each time we modified it by adding elastic bands and we added a pusher for <br>
	the arena as can be in other page.</p>
